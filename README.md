# 1. Project description
The primary goal of the project was to create a web application that implements functionalities commonly found in electronic gradebooks used by teachers in primary and secondary schools. The list of required functionalities was determined based on an analysis of the three most popular electronic gradebooks in Poland: [Vulcan UONET+](https://uonetplus.vulcan.net.pl/), [Librus Synergia](https://portal.librus.pl/rodzina/synergia/loguj), and [MobiDziennik](https://mobidziennik.pl/logowanie).

As part of the project, four user roles were identified: administrator, teacher, parent, and student. Each role was assigned specific permissions. The teacher is able to grade students, monitor attendance, post announcements and surveys, and restrict access to them for specific user groups. The student has access to view their grades, attendance, class schedule, participate in surveys, and find contact information for their teachers. Additionally, all users are able to exchange private messages, and the application sends email notifications in response to specific system events.
